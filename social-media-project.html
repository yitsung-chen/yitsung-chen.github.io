              <p class="project-section-context social-media">
                Throughout the course of 2019, I was hired as an analyst in Teledirect, an outsourced company
                based at Singapore and was assigned to the advertising optimization program. Our goal was to
                help our client ( I may only refer to as "a gloabl leading social media company" due to NDA ) boost
                growth in terms of sales, marketing, and branding of its advertising product in APAC and Oceania
                regions.

              <h1 class="project-section-title">What did I do?</h1>
              <p class="project-section-context social-media">
                As one of the only two analysts in the team, one of my main responsibility was to fully cover the
                data dashboard design and development for the marketing team. The process started from communicating
                with the stakeholders on metrics definition, including the top KPI the team was tracking, and other
                supportive metrics helped the team leaders capture key correlations driving the growth or decline.
              </p>
              <p class="project-section-context social-media">
                The other main duty was to find a sustainable solution for operation team to manage agents' workforce.
                I helped redesign the workforce dashboard, enhancing the power to optimize the market productivity and
                helped team leaders to better manage agents' leave balance so the leaves won't cause underproductive penalty.

              <h1 class="project-section-title">What did I learn?</h1>
              <p class="project-section-context social-media">
                The <b>"Moving Fast"</b> nature of our client's motto surely influenced me from the ground up. I was frustrated
                at the beginning because I tended to consider carefully for the solutions I came up and only delivered until I
                was about 95% certain to do so. However, in such rapid growing world, my approach was not always accepted. I was
                very lucky to work with my past managers and team leaders, who taught me patiently and always willing to help me
                speed up. Throughout the process, I gradually became much confident to deliver my solution quickly to the team
                which was a huge takeaway I learned from this job :
              </p>
              <q class="project-section-context feedbacks social-media">Start quick, get a quick loss, then
                revisit the problem and try another way fast, focus on the areas that need the most attention, and continue to improve.</q>
              <p class="project-section-context social-media">Additionally, a smooth communication is always the best cataylst
                to speed up the process. After all, no one will take action on my analysis unless I communicate well with the stakeholders.
                A good analyst is not a number cruncher, data is just part of the materials to help structure the solution, yet it is always
                the person who leverages the power of materials and build up the solution. Data is important, but not as much as people,
                the lesson I learned was :
              </p>
              <q class="project-section-context feedbacks social-media">Analyze with logic ; Communicate with empathy.</q>
              <p class="project-section-context social-media">
                The journey is full of many excitments, but as I am only able to reveal so much, I would encourage you to contact me If you
                want to learn more details. Thank you very much.
